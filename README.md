## ðŸ§ª Lab Topology (Work in Progress)

The automation in this repo is being built and tested using the topology shown below. The environment includes a mix of Cisco IOS XE (CSR), IOS XR, and NX-OS devices connected to a management Linux host running Ansible.

While automation scripts for all devices are not yet implemented, this layout guides the structure and testing of each playbook over time.

This topology will evolve as additional roles and platform-specific playbooks are added.
